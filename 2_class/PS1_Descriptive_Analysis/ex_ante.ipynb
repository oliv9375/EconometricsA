As you may remember from Microeconomics A, an Engel Curve describes how demand for an individual product depends on income, holding prices fixed.

Amongst normal goods, demand for **luxury goods** grows at an _increasing_ rate when income grows, while demand for **necessity goods** grows at a _decreasing_ rate (as illustrated below).\n",

For example, to explore the relationship between alcohol and tobaco consumption,  we can specify: \n",

For example, to explore the relationship between alcohol and tobaco consumption by gender, we can use this command: \n",

    "\n",
    "If we want to group the data by some category, e.g. gender, we can use the method `df.groupby('dmale')` before we use the `.describe()` method. \n",

    "df[df.dmale == 0].describe()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the `.describe()` method, we usually need to create a view where we narrow down our DataFrame so it only shows the variables of interest. Otherwise, the resulting table becomes way too big – especially when we also group by categories. If for example we want to compute descriptive statistics for only the alcohol, tobacco and recreation expenditure variables, you can use the code:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "vars = ['xalc', 'xtob', 'xrecr']\n",
    "df[vars].describe()\n",
